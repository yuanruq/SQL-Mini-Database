      <p>
          After deploying a BDB JE HA application, you may later want to
          upgrade to a new version.  Berkeley DB JE supports hot upgrade of a
          replication group, by allowing mixed version operation.  That is,
          replication nodes running the newer software version can
          inter-operate with older version nodes and both can be available for
          user operations.  However, in some cases, there are certain
          constraints to performing such a hot upgrade.
      </p>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
                Each release of Berkeley DB JE is tied to a given log file
                on-disk format. Log file formats do not necessarily change
                every release. The Change Log for each release specifies
                whether the log file format has changed or not. There are
                no restrictions on upgrades across releases that use the
                same log file format. For best performance and to take
                advantage of bug fixes, ensure all nodes in a replication
                group run with the same BDB JE version during normal
                operations.  Occasionally, a new release of Berkeley DB JE
                includes a log file format change. The constraints that
                apply to upgrades which introduce new log file formats are
                explained in this section.
            </p>
        <p>
                In a replication group, the Master transmits log records
                that must be read by the replicas. If a group is operating
                with mixed version nodes, the Master must be running an
                older or equal version to that of the Replicas, so that all
                Replicas are able to understand the replication stream.  To
                support this requirement, BDB JE always elects a node that
                runs with the lowest log version as the Master, until the
                majority of nodes in this group are upgraded.  After that
                point, JE can elect a node with any version as the Master. 
            </p>

          <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
          <p>
                    User specified node priorities can overrule this
                    default policy, so you should consider their impact
                    when upgrading.
                </p>
        </div>
        <p>
                The recommended steps for upgrading Berkeley DB JE HA when
                log file formats have changed are as follows:
            </p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>
                        Bring all Replicas up to date with the Master. That
                        is, all Replicas must have the same environment
                        content as the Master. You can ascertain this by
                        using the <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/util/DbGroupAdmin.html#dumpGroup()(com.sleepycat.je.rep.util.DbGroupAdmin)" target="_top">DbGroupAdmin.dumpGroup()</a> utility, or
                        programmatically using the

            <li>
              <p>
                        Perform the following upgrade procedures on each of
                        the environments that are part of the replication
                        group.

                        Upgrade each individual Replica and restart them to
                        join the replication group.

        </div>
        <p>
                 When the Master is shut down, one of the Replicas running the
                 new version is elected as the Master.  From that point onward,
                 the Master writes data in the new format.  After the former
                 Master is upgraded it is restarted as a Replica.

                    Upgrading BDB JE 4.0 directly to BDB JE 5 and higher

                    4.1 first, and then upgrade BDB JE 4.1 to higher
                    versions. There is no constraint if you upgrade from
                    BDB JE 4.1 or later versions to a higher BDB JE
                    version.

            There are exceptions that you may run into during the upgrade
            process.  The following exceptions may be thrown when a
            replication group node is restarted during the upgrade, and a
            ReplicatedEnvironment object is instantiated:
          </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/RollbackException.html" target="_top">RollbackException</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                    This exception can be thrown by a Replica when its log
                    is ahead of the current Master and the Replica is
                    unable to rollback without a recovery. As a
                    consequence, one or more of the most recently committed
                    transactions may need to be rolled back, before the
                    Replica can synchronize its state with that of the
                    current Master. This exception can also be thrown if
                    the current Master crashes.  To solve this exception
                    restart the ReplicatedEnvironment with the new JE
                    version.
                </p>

                </p>
              <p>
                    During synchronization, a Replica that has a newer log,
                    may have to roll back a number of committed
                    tranactions.  If the number of rolled back transactions
                    exceeds the limit defined by <a class="ulink" href="../java/com/sleepycat/je/rep/ReplicationConfig.html#TXN_ROLLBACK_LIMIT" target="_top">TXN_ROLLBACK_LIMIT</a>, the
                    Replica throws a RollbackProhibitedException.  To solve
                    this exception you may have to truncate logs manually
                    by using DbTruncateLog and restart the
                    ReplicatedEnvironment with the new JE version.

                </p>
              <p>
                    EnvironmentFailureException is thrown due to log
                    version incompatibility between the Master and the
                    Replica.  This exception is thrown with the message:

              <p>
                    "Incompatible log versions. Feeder log version: xxxx,
