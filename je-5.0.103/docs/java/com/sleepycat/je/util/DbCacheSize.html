<div class="block">Estimates the in-memory cache size needed to hold a specified data set.  To
 get an estimate of the in-memory footprint for a given database, specify the
 number of records and database characteristics and DbCacheSize will return a
 minimum and maximum estimate of the cache size required for holding the
 database in memory.  Based on this information a JE cache size can be chosen
 and then configured using <a href="../../../../com/sleepycat/je/EnvironmentMutableConfig.html#setCacheSize(long)"><code>EnvironmentMutableConfig.setCacheSize(long)</code></a> or using
 the <a href="../../../../com/sleepycat/je/EnvironmentConfig.html#MAX_MEMORY"><code>EnvironmentConfig.MAX_MEMORY</code></a> property.

 <h4>Importance of the JE Cache</h4>

 The JE cache is not an optional cache. It is used to hold the metadata for
 accessing JE data.  In fact the JE cache size is probably the most critical
 factor to JE performance, since Btree nodes will have to be fetched during a
 database read or write operation if they are not in cache. During a single
 read or write operation, at each level of the Btree that a fetch is
 necessary, an IO may be necessary at a different disk location for each
 fetch.  In addition, if internal nodes (INs) are not in cache, then write
 operations will cause additional copies of the INs to be written to storage,
 as modified INs are moved out of the cache to make room for other parts of
 the Btree during subsequent operations.  This additional fetching and
 writing means that sizing the cache too small to hold the INs will result in
 lower operation performance.
 <p>
 For best performance, all Btree nodes should fit in the JE cache, including
 leaf nodes (LNs), which hold the record data, and INs, which hold record
 keys and other metadata.  However, because system memory is limited, it is
 sometimes necessary to size the cache to hold all or at least most INs, but
 not the LNs.  This utility estimates the size necessary to hold only INs,
 and the size to hold INs and LNs.
 <p>
 When most or all LNs do <em>not</em> fit in cache, using <a href="../../../../com/sleepycat/je/CacheMode.html#EVICT_LN"><code>CacheMode.EVICT_LN</code></a> can be beneficial to reduce the Java GC cost of
 collecting the LNs as they are moved out of cache.  A recommended approach
 is to size the JE cache to hold all INs and size the Java heap to hold that
 amount plus the amount needed for GC working space and application objects,
 leaving any additional memory for use by the file system cache to hold LNs.
 Tests show this approach results in low GC overhead and predictable latency.

 <h4>Estimating the JE Cache Size</h4>

 Estimating JE in-memory sizes is not straightforward for several reasons.
 There is some fixed overhead for each Btree internal node, so fanout
 (maximum number of child entries per parent node) and degree of node
 sparseness impacts memory consumption. In addition, JE uses various compact
 in-memory representations that depend on key sizes, key prefixing, how many
 child nodes are resident, etc.  The physical proximity of node children also
 allows compaction of child physical address values.
 <p>
 Therefore, when running this utility it is important to specify all <a href="../../../../com/sleepycat/je/EnvironmentConfig.html" title="class in com.sleepycat.je"><code>EnvironmentConfig</code></a> and <a href="../../../../com/sleepycat/je/DatabaseConfig.html" title="class in com.sleepycat.je"><code>DatabaseConfig</code></a> settings that will be used in
 a production system.  The <a href="../../../../com/sleepycat/je/EnvironmentConfig.html" title="class in com.sleepycat.je"><code>EnvironmentConfig</code></a> settings are specified
 by command line options for each property, using the same names as the
 <a href="../../../../com/sleepycat/je/EnvironmentConfig.html" title="class in com.sleepycat.je"><code>EnvironmentConfig</code></a> parameter name values.  For example, <a href="../../../../com/sleepycat/je/EnvironmentConfig.html#LOG_FILE_MAX"><code>EnvironmentConfig.LOG_FILE_MAX</code></a>, which influences the amount of memory used
 to store physical record addresses, can be specified on the command line as:
 <p>
 <code>-je.log.fileMax LENGTH</code>
 <p>
 To be sure that this utility takes into account all relevant settings,
 especially as the utility enhanced in future versions, it is best to specify
 all <a href="../../../../com/sleepycat/je/EnvironmentConfig.html" title="class in com.sleepycat.je"><code>EnvironmentConfig</code></a> settings used by the application.
 <p>
 The <a href="../../../../com/sleepycat/je/DatabaseConfig.html" title="class in com.sleepycat.je"><code>DatabaseConfig</code></a> settings are specified using command line options
 defined by this utility.
 <ul>
   <li><code>-nodemax ENTRIES</code> corresponds to <a href="../../../../com/sleepycat/je/DatabaseConfig.html#setNodeMaxEntries(int)"><code>DatabaseConfig.setNodeMaxEntries(int)</code></a>.</li>
   <li><code>-duplicates</code> corresponds to passing true to <a href="../../../../com/sleepycat/je/DatabaseConfig.html#setSortedDuplicates(boolean)"><code>DatabaseConfig.setSortedDuplicates(boolean)</code></a>.  Note that duplicates are configured
   for DPL MANY_TO_ONE and MANY_TO_MANY secondary indices.</li>
   <li><code>-keyprefix LENGTH</code> corresponds to passing true <a href="../../../../com/sleepycat/je/DatabaseConfig.html#setKeyPrefixing(boolean)"><code>DatabaseConfig.setKeyPrefixing(boolean)</code></a>.  Note that key prefixing is always used
   when duplicates are configured.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 This utility estimates the JE cache size by creating an in-memory
 Environment and Database.  In addition to the size of the Database, the
 minimum overhead for the Environment is output.  The Environment overhead
 shown is likely to be smaller than actually needed because it doesn't take
 into account use of memory by JE daemon threads (cleaner, checkpointer, etc)
 or the memory used for locks that are held by application operations and
 transactions.  An additional amount should be added to account for these
 factors.
 <p>
 This utility estimates the cache size for a single JE Database.  To estimate
 the size for multiple Databases with different configuration parameters or
 different key and data sizes, run this utility for each Database and sum the
 sizes.  If you are summing multiple runs for multiple Databases that are
 opened in a single Environment, the overhead size for the Environment should
 only be added once.
 <p>
 In some applications with databases having variable key and data sizes, it
 may be difficult to determine the key and data size input parameters for
 this utility.  If a representative data set can be created, one approach is
 to use the <a href="../../../../com/sleepycat/je/util/DbPrintLog.html" title="class in com.sleepycat.je.util"><code>DbPrintLog</code></a> utility with the <code>-S</code> option to find the
 average key and data size for all databases, and use these values as input
 parameters, as if there were only a single database.  With this approach, it
 is important that the <code>DatabaseConfig</code> parameters are the same, or at
 least similar, for all databases.

 <h4>Key Prefixing and Compaction</h4>
 
 Key prefixing deserves special consideration.  It can significantly reduce
 the size of the cache and is generally recommended; however, the benefit can
 be difficult to predict.  Key prefixing, in turn, impacts the benefits of
 key compaction, and the use of the <a href="../../../../com/sleepycat/je/EnvironmentConfig.html#TREE_COMPACT_MAX_KEY_LENGTH"><code>EnvironmentConfig.TREE_COMPACT_MAX_KEY_LENGTH</code></a> parameter.
 <p>
 For a given data set, the impact of key prefixing is determined by how many
 leading bytes are in common for the keys in a single bottom internal node
 (BIN).  For example, if keys are assigned sequentially as long (8 byte)
 integers, and the <a href="../../../../com/sleepycat/je/DatabaseConfig.html#setNodeMaxEntries(int)"><code>maximum entries
 per node</code></a> is 128 (the default value) then 6 or 7 of the 8 bytes of the key
 will have a common prefix in each BIN.  Of course, when records are deleted,
 the number of prefixed bytes may be reduced because the range of key values
 in a BIN will be larger.  For this example we will assume that, on average,
 5 bytes in each BIN are a common prefix leaving 3 bytes per key that are
 unprefixed.
 <p>
 Key compaction is applied when the number of unprefixed bytes is less than a
 configured value; see <a href="../../../../com/sleepycat/je/EnvironmentConfig.html#TREE_COMPACT_MAX_KEY_LENGTH"><code>EnvironmentConfig.TREE_COMPACT_MAX_KEY_LENGTH</code></a>.
 In the example, the 3 unprefixed bytes per key is less than the default used
 for key compaction (16 bytes).  This means that each key will use 16 bytes
 of memory, in addition to the amount used for the prefix for each BIN.  The
 per-key overhead could be reduced by changing the <code>TREE_COMPACT_MAX_KEY_LENGTH</code> parameter to a smaller value, but care should
 be taken to ensure the compaction will be effective as keys are inserted and
 deleted over time.
 <p>
 Because key prefixing depends so much on the application key format and the
 way keys are assigned, the number of expected prefix bytes must be estimated
 by the user and specified to DbCacheSize using the <code>-keyprefix</code>
 argument.

 <h4>Key Prefixing and Duplicates</h4>
 
 When <a href="../../../../com/sleepycat/je/DatabaseConfig.html#setSortedDuplicates(boolean)"><code>duplicates</code></a> are configured
 for a Database (including DPL MANY_TO_ONE and MANY_TO_MANY secondary
 indices), key prefixing is always used.  This is because the internal key in
 a duplicates database BIN is formed by concatenating the user-specified key
 and data.  In secondary databases with duplicates configured, the data is
 the primary key, so the internal key is the concatenation of the secondary
 key and the primary key.
 <p>
 Key prefixing is always used for duplicates databases because prefixing is
 necessary to store keys efficiently.  When the number of duplicates per
 unique user-specified key is more than the number of entries per BIN, the
 entire user-specified key will be the common prefix.
 <p>
 For example, a database that stores user information may use email address
 as the primary key and zip code as a secondary key.  The secondary index
 database will be a duplicates database, and the internal key stored in the
 BINs will be a two part key containing zip code followed by email address.
 If on average there are more users per zip code than the number of entries
 in a BIN, then the key prefix will normally be at least as long as the zip
 code key.  If there are less (more than one zip code appears in each BIN),
 then the prefix will be shorter than the zip code key.
 <p>
 It is also possible for the key prefix to be larger than the secondary key.
 If for one secondary key value (one zip code) there are a large number of
 primary keys (email addresses), then a single BIN may contain concatenated
 keys that all have the same secondary key (same zip code) and have primary
 keys (email addresses) that all have some number of prefix bytes in common.
 Therefore, when duplicates are specified it is possible to specify a prefix
 size that is larger than the key size.
 <p>
 DbCacheSize requires that <code>-keyprefix</code> is specified whenever <code>-duplicates</code> is specified.

 <h4>Running the DbCacheSize utility</h4>

 Usage:
 <pre>
 java { com.sleepycat.je.util.DbCacheSize |
        -jar je-&lt;version&gt;.jar DbCacheSize }
  -records <count>
      # Total records (key/data pairs); required
  -key <bytes>
      # Average key bytes per record; required
  [-data <bytes>]
      # Average data bytes per record; if omitted no leaf
      # node sizes are included in the output; required with
      # -duplicates, and specifies the primary key length
  [-keyprefix <bytes>]
      # Expected size of the prefix for the keys in each
      # BIN; default: key prefixing is not configured;
      # required with -duplicates
  [-nodemax <entries>]
      # Number of entries per Btree node; default: 128
  [-orderedinsertion]
      # Assume ordered insertions and no deletions, so BINs
      # are 100% full; default: unordered insertions and/or
      # deletions, BINs are 70% full
  [-duplicates]" +
      # Indicates that sorted duplicates are used, including
      # MANY_TO_ONE and MANY_TO_MANY secondary indices
  [-replicated]
      # Use a ReplicatedEnvironment; default: false
  [-ENV_PARAM_NAME VALUE]...
      # Any number of EnvironmentConfig parameters and
      # ReplicationConfig parameters (if -replicated)
  [-outputproperties]
      # Writes Java properties file to System.out:
      #  overhead, minInternalNodes, maxInternalNodes,
      #  minAllNodes, maxAllNodes (with -data)
 </pre>
 <p>
 You should run DbCacheSize on the same target platform and JVM for which you
 are sizing the cache, as cache sizes will vary.  You may also need to
 specify -d32 or -d64 depending on your target, if the default JVM mode is
 not the same as the mode to be used in production.
 <p>
 To take full advantage of JE cache memory, it is strongly recommended that
 <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/vm/performance-enhancements-7.html#compressedOop">compressed oops</a>
 (<code>-XX:+UseCompressedOops</code>) is specified when a 64-bit JVM is used
 and the maximum heap size is less than 32 GB.  As described in the
 referenced documentation, compressed oops is sometimes the default JVM mode
 even when it is not explicitly specified in the Java command.  However, if
 compressed oops is desired then it <em>must</em> be explicitly specified in
 the Java command when running DbCacheSize or a JE application.  If it is not
 explicitly specified then JE will not aware of it, even if it is the JVM
 default setting, and will not take it into account when calculating cache
 memory sizes.
 <p>
 For example:
 <pre>
 $ java -jar je-X.Y.Z.jar DbCacheSize -records 554719 -key 16 -data 100

  === Environment Cache Overhead ===

  3,161,086 minimum bytes

  To account for JE daemon operation and record locks,
  a significantly larger amount is needed in practice.

  === Database Cache Size ===

   Minimum Bytes    Maximum Bytes   Description
  ---------------  ---------------  -----------
       19,891,344       23,118,992  Internal nodes only
      115,331,040      118,558,688  Internal nodes and leaf nodes

  === Internal Node Usage by Btree Level ===

   Minimum Bytes    Maximum Bytes      Nodes    Level
  ---------------  ---------------  ----------  -----
       19,596,552       22,787,848       6,233    1
          290,640          326,480          70    2
            4,152            4,664           1    3
 </pre>
 <p>
 This indicates that the minimum memory size to hold only the internal nodes
 of the Database Btree is approximately 20MB. The maximum size to hold the
 entire database, both internal nodes and data records, is approximately
 119MB.  To either of these amounts, at least 3MB (plus more for locks and
 daemons) should be added to account for the environment overhead.</div>
