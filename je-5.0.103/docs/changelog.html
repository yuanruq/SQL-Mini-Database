<h2 align="center">Oracle Berkeley DB Java Edition 11G R2 Change Log
</h2>
<p align="center">Library Version 11.2.5.0,  Release 5.0.103</p>

<!-- =================================================== -->
<h3><a name="FileFormat">Log File On-Disk Format Changes:</a></h3>
JE 5.0.103 has moved to on-disk file format 8.
<p>
The change is forward compatible in that JE files created with release
4.1 and earlier can be read when opened with JE 5.0.103. The
change is not backward compatible in that files created with JE 5.0
cannot be read by earlier releases. Note that if an existing
environment is opened read/write, a new log file is written by JE 5.0
and the environment can no longer be read by earlier releases.
<p>
There are two important notes about the file format change.
<ol>
    <li>
    The file format change enabled significant improvements in operation
    performance, memory and disk footprint, and concurrency of databases with
    duplicate keys. Due to these changes, an upgrade utility must be run before
    opening an environment with this release, if the environment was created
    using JE 4.1 or earlier. See the Upgrade Procedure below for more
    information.
    </li>
    <li>
    An application which uses JE replication may not upgrade directly from JE
    4.0 to JE 5.0. Instead, the upgrade must be done from JE 4.0 to JE 4.1 and
    then to JE 5.0. Applications already at JE 4.1 are not affected. Upgrade
    guidance can be found in the new chapter, "Upgrading a JE Replication
    Group", in the "Getting Started with BDB JE High Availability" guide.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Upgrade Procedure</h3>

Due to the format changes in JE 5, a special utility program must be run for an
environment created with JE 4.1 or earlier, prior to opening the environment
with JE 5.0 or later.  The utility program is part of JE 4.1.  JE 4.1.20, or a
later version of JE 4.1, must be used.
<p>
One of two utility programs must be used, which are available in the release
package for JE 4.1.20, or a later release of JE 4.1.  If you are currently
running a release earlier than JE 4.1.20, then you must download the latest JE
4.1 release package in order to run these utilities.
<p>
The steps for upgrading are as follows.
<ol>
    <li>Stop the application using BDB JE.</li>
    <li>Run the DbPreUpgrade_4_1 or DbRepPreUpgrade_4_1 utility.
        If you are using a regular non-replicated <code>Environment</code>:
<pre>    java -jar je-4.1.20.jar DbPreUpgrade_4_1 -h &lt;dir&gt;</pre>
        If you are using a JE <code>ReplicatedEnvironment</code>:
<pre>    java -jar je-4.1.20.jar DbRepPreUpgrade_4_1
         -h &lt;dir&gt;
         -groupName &lt;group name&gt;
         -nodeName &lt;node name&gt;
         -nodeHostPort &lt;host:port&gt;</pre></li>
    <li>Finally, start the application using the current JE 5.0 (or later)
    release of BDB JE.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The second step -- running the utility program -- does not perform data
conversion.  This step simply performs a special checkpoint to prepare the
environment for upgrade.  It should take no longer than an ordinary startup and
shutdown.
<p>
During the last step -- when the application opens the JE environment using the
current release (JE 5 or later) -- all databases configured for duplicates will
automatically be converted before the <code>Environment</code> or
<code>ReplicatedEnvironment</code> constructor returns.  Note that a database
might be explicitly configured for duplicates using
<code>DatabaseConfig.setSortedDuplicates(true)</code>, or implicitly configured
for duplicates by using a DPL MANY_TO_XXX relationship
(<code>Relationship.MANY_TO_ONE</code> or
<code>Relationship.MANY_TO_MANY</code>).
<p>
The duplicate database conversion only rewrites internal nodes in the Btree,
not leaf nodes.  In a test with a 500 MB cache, conversion of a 10 million
record data set (8 byte key and data) took between 1.5 and 6.5 minutes,
depending on number of duplicates per key.  The high end of this range is when
10 duplicates per key were used; the low end is with 1 million duplicates per
key.
<p>
To make the duplicate database conversion predictable during deployment, users
should measure the conversion time on a non-production system before upgrading
a deployed system.  When duplicates are converted, the Btree internal nodes are
preloaded into the JE cache.  A new configuration option,
<code>EnvironmentConfig.ENV_DUP_CONVERT_PRELOAD_ALL</code>, can be set to false
to optimize this process if the cache is not large enough to hold the internal
nodes for all databases.  For more information, see the javadoc for this
property.
<p>
If an application has no databases configured for duplicates, then the last
step simply opens the JE environment normally, and no data conversion is
performed.
<p>
If the user fails to run the DbPreUpgrade_4_1 or DbRepPreUpgrade_4_1 utility
program before opening an environment with JE 5 for the first time, an
exception such as the following will normally be thrown by the
<code>Environment</code> or <code>ReplicatedEnvironment</code> constructor:
<pre>
  com.sleepycat.je.EnvironmentFailureException: (JE 5.0.46) JE 4.1 duplicate DB
  entries were found in the recovery interval. Before upgrading to JE 5.0, the
  following utility must be run using JE 4.1 (4.1.20 or later):
  DbPreUpgrade_4_1.  See the change log.
  UNEXPECTED_STATE: Unexpected internal state, may have side effects.
    at com.sleepycat.je.EnvironmentFailureException.unexpectedState(EnvironmentFailureException.java:376)
    at com.sleepycat.je.recovery.RecoveryManager.checkLogVersion8UpgradeViolations(RecoveryManager.java:2694)
    at com.sleepycat.je.recovery.RecoveryManager.buildTree(RecoveryManager.java:549)
    at com.sleepycat.je.recovery.RecoveryManager.recover(RecoveryManager.java:198)
    at com.sleepycat.je.dbi.EnvironmentImpl.finishInit(EnvironmentImpl.java:610)
    ...  </pre>
<p>
If the user fails to run the DbPreUpgrade_4_1 or DbRepPreUpgrade_4_1 utility
program, but no exception is thrown when the environment is opened with JE 5,
this is probably because the application performed an
<code>Environment.sync</code> before last closing the environment with JE 4.1
or earlier, and nothing else happened to be written (by the application or JE
background threads) after the sync operation.  In this case, running the
upgrade utility is not necessary.

DESCRIPTION
[#SR] (5.0.XX)
</li><br>

<li>
...
</li><br>
 -->

<li>
Fix cast exception when calling EnvironmentStat.getAvgBatchManual() method.
[#23060] (5.0.99)
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug that could cause an IndexOutOfBoundsException when logging the
Environment statistics by the StatLogger. 
[#22885] (5.0.98)
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug that could cause an EnvironmentFailureException with the message
"DB not found during non-recovery undo/rollback", when a transaction is
invalidated in one thread and concurrently used in another thread to perform
a write operation.  This could only occur with using a transactional,
non-replicated database, in a replicated environment.
[#22875] (5.0.98)
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug that could cause the following exception, when an Error is thrown
and caught concurrently by two threads performing JE operations.
<pre>
 Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Can't overwrite cause
    at java.lang.Throwable.initCause(Throwable.java:320)
    at com.sleepycat.je.dbi.EnvironmentImpl.invalidate(EnvironmentImpl.java:1529)
    ...
</pre>
[#22837] (5.0.98)
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug that sometimes resulted in an uncommitted record deletion performed
in one transaction to be visible (result in a NOTFOUND result) to an operation
performed in another transaction.
[#22892] (5.0.98)
</li><br>

<li>
Added a new statistic for cheaply checking the current utilization of the log,
without having to run the DbSpace utility:
EnvironmentStats.getLastKnownUtilization.  See the javadoc for details.
[#22911] (5.0.98)
</li><br>

<li>
Added a column named time that contains the time the data was logged to 
the je.config.csv environment statistics file.
[#22919] (5.0.98)
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug that caused immutable Environment configuration properties to not
have the correct value in the je.config.csv file.
[#22923] (5.0.98)
</li><br>

<li>
Improved performance when "no sync" durability is used, by performing writes
of the buffer outside of the global write lock.  This also prevents writing
multiple buffers in a single thread, which could cause performance issues on
some systems.  [#22988] (5.0.100)
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug that prevented exclusive lock-out of application threads during a
preload (via Database.preload or Environment.preload).  If applications threads
were able to write during the preload, this could cause corruption.
[#23017] (5.0.101)
</li><br>

<li>
The JE cleaner now wakes up whenever a database is removed or truncated.  This
ensures that disk space is reclaimed as soon as possible, even when there is
little or no write activity.
[#22915] (5.0.101)
</li><br>

<li>
CacheMode.EVICT_LN now leaves the parent INs hot after an operation, rather
than forcing them to be cold.  This allows using EVICT_LN to avoid Java GC
problems, while still using an LRU for eviction.
[#23066] (5.0.101)
</li><br>

<li>
Fix DbFilterStat utility to work with the je.config.csv file. Also added
envcfg: to the EnvironmentConfig column names in the je.config.csv file.
[#22996] (5.0.102)
</li><br>

<li>
Fix a bug where a NullPointerException was thrown by Database.openCursor when
called after closing an invalid Environment.
[#23083] (5.0.102)
</li><br>

</ol>

<!-- =================================================== -->
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><u>Changes in 5.0.97</u></h3>
<!-- ================================================= -->
<ol>

<li>
Fixed a bug that causes excessive logging when an environment directory is
forcibly removed while the environment is open, during a unit test for example.
[#22625] (5.0.85)
</li><br>

<li>
The internal JE thread for capturing statistics is no longer created when the
EnvironmentConfig.STATS_COLLECT config param is false.
[#22659] (5.0.85)
</li><br>

<li>
In an HA application, the probability of hard rollbacks during a master
transfer operation has been reduced.
[#22658] (5.0.85)
</li><br>

<li>
Updated the logging and stats file formats to print times in UTC
timezone and in a consistent format that includes the full year.  The
new format is "2013-07-31 13:47:27.753 UTC".  [#22670] (5.0.85)
</li><br>

<li>
Add -outputproperties switch to DbCacheSize.  This causes the calculated sizes
to be written to System.out in Java properties format.  See the DbCacheSize
usage command in the javadoc for details.
[#22719] (5.0.86)
</li><br>

<li>
Shutdown HA feeder threads and the replica thread promptly as a result of an
EnvironmentFailureException instead of waiting for the environment handle to be
closed. The change makes for faster, more robust failover and reduces dependence
on application behavior.  [#22637] (5.0.86)
</li><br>

<li>
Eliminates duplicate log messages associated with an
InsufficientLogException. The message was logged twice: the first time as a
WARNING and again as SEVERE. With this change, the message is logged just once,
as a WARNING.  
[#22789] (5.0.87)
</li><br>

<li>
Added the EnvironmentConfig.CLEANER_ADJUST_UTILIZATION boolean configuration
parameter, to allow disabling of undesired automatic adjustments to log
utilization.  By default, adjustments are enabled, and the default behavior has
not changed.  For more information, see the javadoc for this parameter.
[#22768] (5.0.88)
</li><br>

<li>
A performance enhancement was made to improve multi-threaded write performance.
The checksum computation was moved out of the critical section during which a
global mutex is held.  This, together with earlier improvements to the write
path, improve write performance overall for multi-threaded applications.
However, the performance improvements are limited to standalone JE
applications; performance is not improved for HA applications.
[#16925] (5.0.97)
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug that could cause the following exception when an error occurs while
reading from the log, and a CRUD operation is in progress.  The error while
reading invalidates the Environment and no further operations are possible, but
the incorrect exception may be misleading.
<pre>
com.sleepycat.je.EnvironmentFailureException: (JE 5.0.86) Latch not held:
IN1419 UNEXPECTED_STATE: Unexpected internal state, may have side effects.

    ...
</pre>
[#22772] (5.0.97)
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug that in rare conditions could cause a SecondaryIntegrityException
such as the following.  This could occur when a given key is being inserted
and deleted concurrently in two different threads, and another thread is
reading the record using read-uncommitted isolation.  This bug is present is
all earlier versions of JE 5 and JE 4.x.
<pre>
Caused by: com.sleepycat.je.SecondaryIntegrityException: (JE 5.0.83) Secondary
refers to a missing key in the primary database
    at com.sleepycat.je.Database.secondaryRefersToMissingPrimaryKey(Database.java:2252)

    ...
</pre>
[#22603] (5.0.97)
</li><br>

<li>
JE now logs a SEVERE message as follows in the je.info file at startup when
-XX:+UseCompressedOops is specified but the heap size is larger than the
maximum required value on the JVM platform for using this option.  For example,
on the Oracle JVM, -Xmx29g or smaller must be specified to use this option.  On
non-Oracle JVM platforms (more specifically those JVM platforms not including
the com.sun.management.HotSpotDiagnosticMXBean class), JE does not currently
detect this situation and does not log a message.
<pre>
2013-08-29 19:41:45.965 UTC SEVERE [.] -XX:+UseCompressedOops was specified but
is not in effect, probably because the heap size is too large for this JVM
option on this platform.  This is likely to cause an OutOfMemoryError!
</pre>
Note that in this situation, and presumably on all JVMs, the JVM itself also
outputs a warning message at startup such as the following:
<pre>
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: Max heap size too large for Compressed Oops
</pre>
[#22657] (5.0.97)
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed problems related to log cleaning and the estimation of log utilization.
Previously, in one reported case log utilization was adjusted incorrectly (see
EnvironmentConfig.CLEANER_ADJUST_UTILIZATION), resulting in very small values
for the LNSizeCorrectionFactor (EnvironmentStats.getLNSizeCorrectionFactor()).
In addition, repeated probing of the same log file was observed.  Both of these
problems have been fixed.  Thanks to Vinoth for
<a href="https://forums.oracle.com/message/11174300">reporting</a> this on OTN
and working with us to find the problem.
[#22814] (5.0.97)
</li><br>

<li>
Change Learner Agent to only respond to a query for a master when it's in the
Master or Replica state, to ensure that the master information is current.
Prior to this change, obsolete information could prevent the replication group
from recovering on it's own and electing a new master in some rare
circumstances. [#22815] (5.0.97)
</li><br>

<li>
Avoid throwing an InsufficientLogException when a Replication Node that has
been inactive for a period exceeding ReplicationConfig.REP_STREAM_TIMEOUT, but
is otherwise reasonably current, rejoins the group. Such Replication Nodes can
now rejoin the group without going through a Network Restore operation.
[#22782] (5.0.97)
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug that could result in a stack trace like the one below: 
<pre>
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: toKey out of range
    at java.util.TreeMap$AscendingSubMap.headMap(TreeMap.java:1719)
    at java.util.TreeSet.headSet(TreeSet.java:338)

    at com.sleepycat.je.utilint.DaemonThread.run(DaemonThread.java:148)
</pre>

This problem could occur in rare circumstances when using the DbBackUp or
DiskOrderedCursor APIs. [#22822] (5.0.97)
</li><br>

<li>
Added EnvironmentConfig.ENV_RECOVERY_FORCE_NEW_FILE, which is to be used after
performing a restore from backup to force creation of a new log file prior to
recovery.  For more information, see the javadoc for this parameter and the
"Restoring from a backup" section in the DbBackup javadoc.  [#22834] (5.0.97)
</li><br>

</ol>

<!-- =================================================== -->
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><u>Changes in 5.0.84</u></h3>
<!-- ================================================= -->
<ol>

<li>
Made it possible to run a JE HA application on a fully disconnected node,
with no available network interface. Previously, doing so resulted in this
exception: 
<blockquote>java.net.InetAddress.getLocalHost() returned loopback address:
&lt;hostname&gt; and no suitable address associated with network
interfaces.
</blockquote>
This could only realistically happen when developing, testing, or
demo-ing a JE HA application, but was still an inconvenience. [#22252] (5.0.74)
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a memory leak caused by calling Environment.cleanLog.  If the Environment
is open for a long period of time, the memory leak eventually causes an
OutOfMemoryError.  The problem does not occur when using the default background
cleaning threads -- it only occurs when the application calls the cleanLog
method explicitly. [#22254] (5.0.75)
</li><br>

<li>
Added a feature that enables the ability to configure the system so
performance statistics are automatically captured and easily imported
to analyze via spreadsheet software. Statistics are tracked and logged
for an Environment that is open in R/W mode. The statistics are logged
in CSV format and written to the log file at a user specified interval.
By default, statistics are written to a filed named je.stat.csv in the
Environment directory. Configuration parameters control the size and
number of rotating log files used (similar to java logging see
java.util.logging.FileHandler). For a rotating set of files, as each
file reaches a given size limit, it is closed, rotated out, and a new
file opened. The name of the log file is je.stat.csv. Successively older
files are named by adding "0", "1", "2", etc into the file name. The
format is je.stat.[version number].csv. 
<p>
Application-supplied statistics may also be added to the JE statistics file
so they may be easily correlated with JE statistics.
<p>
See the following new APIs related to the above new features:
<ul>
    <li>EnvironmentConfig.STATS_COLLECT</li>
    <li>EnvironmentConfig.STATS_MAX_FILES</li>
    <li>EnvironmentConfig.STATS_FILE_ROW_COUNT</li>
    <li>EnvironmentConfig.STATS_COLLECT_INTERVAL</li>
    <li>EnvironmentConfig.STATS_FILE_DIRECTORY</li>
    <li>EnvironmentConfig.setCustomStats</li>
</ul>
<p>
Added a feature that enables the ability to log information about the
Environment configuration. The Environment configuration log file may be
updated at Environment creation/open time or if the Environment configuration
is altered. The name of the file is je.config.csv. The file resides in the
same directory as the je.stats.csv file. This file will contain a maximum of
1000 rows before it is rolled over. Only one version of the file is retained.
The name of the previous version is je.config.1.csv. 
<p>
Fixed a problem that corrects the value for the avgBatch statistic. The number
of batches was being cleared unconditionally when the statistic was acquired.
It is now cleared only if StatConfig.setClear() is true.
<p>
Fixed a problem that corrects the value of the nRootSplits statistic. The value
of the statistic was never cleared. It is now cleared if StatConfig.setClear()
is true.
<p>
Added the com.sleepycat.je.util.DbFilterStats utility. The utility allows the
ability to specify columns of the statistics file to project.
[#22009] (5.0.76)
</li><br>

<li>
Modified the JE HA network restore utility to verify log record
checksums when it reads log files in the process of sending out their
contents. A checksum failure results in an exception that is caught by
the <code>NetworkRestore.execute</code> method, causing it to skip that
log provider and try the next one. This change prevents the network
restore operation from spreading log file corruption to other
nodes.
<p>
As part of this change, also added the
<code>LogVerificationReadableByteChannel</code> utility class for
verifying log file checksums when copying log files using NIO channels,
to provide better copying performance.
<p>
[#21029] (5.0.76)
</li><br>

<li>
Removed a source of thread contention that was noticed while profiling an
everything-in-memory, CPU-intensive application.  The internal methods causing
the contention were: Environment.addReferringHandle and removeReferringHandle.
[#22371] (5.0.76)
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug that caused database removal, truncation, or renaming to loop
forever, following a ReplicaWriteException and an election.  The bug only
applies to HA (replicated) environments when the following sequence occurs:
<ol>
    <li>A replica calls Environment.removeDatabase, truncateDatabase or
    renameDatabase, causing a ReplicaWriteException.</li>
    <li>This replica is elected master.</li>
    <li>This new master (former replica) again calls
    Environment.removeDatabase, truncateDatabase or renameDatabase. This method
    loops forever.</li>
</ol>
This bug does not occur if the ReplicatedEnvironment is closed, normally or
abnormally, in between any two of these steps.
<p>
[#22394] (5.0.76)
</li><br>

<li>
Added support for non-replicated Databases and EntityStores in a replicated
(HA) environment.  Non-replicated databases are intended to be used primarily
for persistent caching and other non-critical local storage.  For more
information, see the "Non-replicated Databases in a Replicated Environment"
section of the ReplicatedEnvironment javadoc.
[#20543] (5.0.76)
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug that prevents opening the Environment with a stack trace such as
the following:
<pre>
Caused by: com.sleepycat.je.EnvironmentFailureException: ...
last LSN=0x21f/0x26 LOG_INTEGRITY: Log information is incorrect, problem is

at com.sleepycat.je.recovery.RecoveryManager.undoLNs(RecoveryManager.java:1053)
...
</pre>
This problem is very unlikely to occur -- the bug has always been present in JE
but was recently reported for the first time.  It may be more likely to occur
for applications that have long transactions.  If the problem does occur using
an earlier version of JE, upgrading to JE 4.1.29 or later will allow the
Environment to be opened and no data loss will occur.
[#22407] (5.0.76)
</li><br>

<li>
Replicas now group transaction commits that request replica durability:
<code>SyncPolicy.SYNC</code>, when the transactions are replayed at the
replica. These changes can provide significant throughput increase and latency
reductions for high throughput applications that
require <code>SyncPolicy.SYNC</code> durability.
<p>This group commit behavior can be controlled by two new replication
configuration parameters:
<code>com.sleepycat.je.rep.ReplicationConfig.REPLICA_MAX_GROUP_COMMIT</code> and 
<code>com.sleepycat.je.rep.ReplicationConfig.REPLICA_GROUP_COMMIT_INTERVAL</code>.

Fixed a NullPointerException in BinaryProtocol.SimpleMessage that
could occur in a JE replication node, that would manifest as the
following stack trace.

...
</pre>
The problem was due to faulty exception handling, and theoretically
could manifest at any time during the life of a JE replication node,
although it seems most likely to happen in reaction to network induced
IOExceptions. The replication node would be invalidated, and would
need to be re-opened by the application. The problem is transient, and
does not affect the data stored persistently.

<li>
Added feature that may increase write performance and decrease disk 
utilization. Transactions may be grouped to amortize the cost of 
write and/or fsync when a transaction commits with SyncPolicy.SYNC
or SyncPolicy.WRITE_NO_SYNC for local transactions.
<p>
This group commit behavior can be controlled by two new environment
configuration parameters:
<code>com.sleepycat.je.EnvironmentConfig.LOG_GROUP_COMMIT_INTERVAL</code> and 
<code>com.sleepycat.je.EnvironmentConfig.LOG_GROUP_COMMIT_THRESHOLD</code>.

<!-- =================================================== -->
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><u>Changes in 5.0.73</u></h3>
<!-- ================================================= -->
<ol>

<li>
Fixed a bug that caused data corruption (for example, resulting in an
EnvironmentFailureException with a LOG_FILE_NOT_FOUND message) under certain
circumstances, when many Databases are created and not all Databases are kept
open.  In fact two bugs were fixed that contributed to the problem.  The first
bug was a memory size calculation error and caused heavy/costly cache eviction,
even when the cache would normally be large enough to avoid such eviction.
This calculation error occurred during log cleaning, and only when closed
databases had been previously evicted from the cache. The second bug caused
Btree corruption when cache eviction was heavy and many closed databases were
evicted.  [#21686] (JE 5.0.61)
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug that prevented CacheMode.EVICT_LN from operating correctly in a
long running Environment where log cleaning is active.  As log cleaning
migrated records (specifically LNs), the memory used by Btree internal nodes
(specifically BINs) increased.  The symptom is that the number of BINs in the
"no target" category (EnvironmentStats.getNNoTarget) is reduced over time, and
the number of BINs in other categories (getNINSparseTarget) increases.  In some
applications this would cause unnecessary eviction and IO, and therefore
decreased performance. [#21734] (JE 5.0.64)
</li><br>

<li>
A JE/HA application may now explicitly transfer the master role, on
demand, from the current master to one of a specified set of currently
active replica nodes in the replication group.  The
<code>transferMaster()</code> methods in the
<code>ReplicatedEnvironment</code> class are provided for this
purpose.  [#18081] (JE 5.0.64)
</li><br>

<li>
It is now possible to restore an entire replication group by
restoring just one node from a backup.  The other nodes in the
group perform a Network Restore from this one node, if that initial
node is included in the list of "helper hosts" configured by the
other nodes.  [#20701] (JE 5.0.64)
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug which could lead to problems if the replication group
master failed to receive transaction acknowledgements from a
majority of existing replicas when making changes to the
composition of the group (for example, adding new nodes, or moving
an existing node to a new network address).  
<p>
In one case, the master would become unable to accept any future group
changes, even after all existing replicas were successfully connected
and providing acknowledgements again.  In another case the normal
protections against duplicate masters could become compromised, making
it possible (although unlikely) for transactions apparently "durably
replicated" to a group majority to nevertheless disappear after a
network partition were repaired.  [#21095] (JE 5.0.64)
</li><br>

<li>
Improved validity checking for replication group name and node
names.  Both of these types of names should consist of letters,
digits, and hyphen, underscore, or period.  [#21407] (JE 5.0.64)
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug where specifying a very short ENV_UNKNOWN_STATE_TIMEOUT
could lead to an UnknownMasterException from the ReplicatedEnvironment
constructor.  [#21427] (JE 5.0.64)
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a DiskOrderedCursor bug where latch deadlocks would occur when the
consumer thread (the application thread calling DiskOrderedCursor.getNext) also
accessed the database being scanned using other APIs, e.g., Database or Cursor
methods.  To allow a DiskOrderedCursor to operate concurrently with other
operations on the same database in the consumer thread, the internal algorithm
for a disk ordered scan has been changed.  See the new Consistency Guarantees
and Performance Considerations sections in the DiskOrderedCursor javadoc.  Also
as part of this fix, the following methods in DiskOrderedCursorConfig have been
deprecated: getMaxSeedMillisecs, setMaxSeedMillisecs, getMaxSeedNodes and
setMaxSeedNodes.  These config properties no longer have any effect.
<p>
Also fixed a bug that caused a null key to be returned by
DiskOrderedCursor.getNext.  The bug occurred infrequently as the result of
concurrent log cleaning activity.  When it occurred, calling
DatabaseEntry.getData for the key parameter would return null, even though
DiskOrderedCursor.getNext returned OperationStatus.SUCCESS.

trace similar to the following, when attempting to open an EntityStore.

[#21869] (JE 5.0.66)
</li><br>

<p>
The log cleaner now outputs "No file selected for cleaning" log messages at
level FINE rather than at level INFO.  (JE 5.0.66)
</li><br>

<li>
Added safeguards to prevent log corruption when an Error (e.g.,
OutOfMemoryError) is thrown by a RandomAccessFile method during a write
operation.  Normally RandomAccessFile methods throw IOExceptions, but on
certain platforms they may throw Errors.  Without the added safeguards, data
corruption could occur when an Error is thrown by RandomAccessFile methods.
Several changes were made along with this fix to support stress testing of IO
errors.
<ul>
    <li>
    When an exception is thrown by a RandomAccessFile method the file lock on
    the je.lck file is released to allow tests to re-open the Environment.
    <li>
    The DbVerifyLog utility and LogVerificationInputStream class now ignore an
    incomplete entry at the end of the last log file in the Environment, since
    such an entry is ignored by recovery when the Environment is opened.  This
    allows IO failure stress tests to use these classes to check the log
    correctly for errors that would prevent recovery.  This behavior is also
    correct for the purpose of verifying log files during a backup.
    <li>
    The DbVerifyLog utility and LogVerificationInputStream class have been
    enhanced to verify correctness of the previous offset in the internal log
    entry header.  An incorrect previous offset value is sometimes a symptom of
    log corruption.
    <li>
    The internal JE background threads (cleaner, checkpointer and compressor)
    now use the java.util.logging package to output exceptions and status
    information instead of writing directly to System.err.
</ul>
[#21929] (JE 5.0.68)
</li><br>

<li>
Removed an overzealous assertion that could fire during periods of heavy
eviction with a stack trace such as the following:
<pre>
java.lang.AssertionError

</pre>
This (like any assertion) would invalidate the Environment, but otherwise did
not cause any persistent damage.
[#21990] (5.0.70)
</li><br> 

<li>
Added a new method that should be used for performing incremental backups:
<code>DbBackup.getLogFilesInSnapshot</code>.  Calling this method rather than
<code>File.list</code> is necessary to prevent the possibility that the log
cleaner will delete files prior to the creation of the backup manifest for the
current snapshot.  If <code>File.list</code> is called, as described previously
in the <code>DbBackup</code> javadoc, the manifest may not contain the files
necessary for a restore and this would invalidate the backup.  For more
information, see the updated description and examples at the top of the
<code>DbBackup</code> class javadoc.
<p>
The code examples in the <code>DbBackup</code> javadoc and the Getting Started
Guide have also been updated to pass the <code>lastFileInPrevBackup</code>
parameter to the <code>DbBackup</code> constructor rather than to the
deprecated <code>getLogFilesInBackupSet</code> method.
<p>
[#22014] (5.0.70)
</li><br> 

<li>
The JE log cleaner now logs a SEVERE level message when the average cleaner
backlog increases over time.  A trailing average of the cleaner backlog is used
to prevent spurious messages.  Some applications may wish to use SEVERE
log messages, such as this one, to trigger alerts.  An example of the message
text is below.
<pre>
121215 13:48:57:480 SEVERE [...] Average cleaner backlog has grown from 0.0 to
6.4. If the cleaner continues to be unable to make progress, the JE cache size
and/or number of cleaner threads are probably too small. If this is not
corrected, eventually all available disk space will be used.
</pre>
For more information on setting the cache size appropriately to avoid such
problems, see:

</li><br> 

<li>
Fixed a bug that could cause a NullPointerException, such as the one below,
when a ReplicatedEnvironment is opened on an HA replica node.  The conditions
that caused the bug are: 1) a replica has been restarted after an abnormal
shutdown (ReplicatedEnvironment.close was not called), 2) a transaction
involving database records was in progress at the time of the abnormal
shutdown, 3) the database is then removed (Environment.removeDatabase), and
finally 4) yet another abnormal shutdown occurs.  If this bug is encountered,
it can be corrected by upgrading to the JE release containing this fix, and no
data loss will occur.

[#22052] (5.0.71)
</li><br> 

<li>
The log cleaner will now delete files in the latter portion of the log, even
when the application is not performing any write operations.  Previously, in a
ReplicatedEnvironment files were prohibited from being deleted in the portion
of the log after the last application write.  When a log cleaner backlog was
present (for example, when the cache had been configured too small, relative to
the data set size and write rate), this could cause the cleaner to operate
continuously without being able to delete files or make forward progress.
<p>
Note that this change only applies to replicated environments.  In
non-replicated environments, deletion of log files has always been allowed (and
is still allowed) in the portion of the log after the last application write.
<p>

<li>
Compiling and running the JE unit tests ("ant test") now require that JUnit

</li><br> 

<li>
Added a new log cleaner statistic to help diagnose problems when record locks
are held by the application and the locks prevent log file deletion after a log
file has been cleaned: EnvironmentStats.getPendingLNQueueSize.
[#22100] (5.0.72)
</li><br> 

<li>
Fixed a bug that caused two EnvironmentStats -- getNCachedBINs and
getNCachedUpperINs -- to be incorrect when calling Environment.removeDatabase
or truncateDatabase.  When a database was removed/truncated, the number of
BINs/INs belonging to that database were not subtracted from these two stats,
even though they were evicted from the cache correctly.  So in an application
where databases are removed/truncated, these two stats were larger than the
actual number of BINs/INs in cache and would increase over time.
<p>
Also added a new cache statistic to help diagnose potential memory leaks:
EnvironmentStats.getDataAdminBytes.
<p>

<li>
Two changes to DbSpace were made.  First, inaccuracies in the the -r

utilization values were due to these inaccuracies.  Second, the -s and -e
options, and corresponding setStartFile and setEndFile methods, have been
added; these allow viewing and (optionally) recalculating a subset of the files
in the log.  Note that the recalculation option is used primarily for analysis
and debugging.

<li>
DbVerify has been improved to add Btree level information for internal

"false", and no exception was thrown.  The same bug impacted boolean properties
specified in the je.properties file with trailing whitespace.
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b> This fix could change the behavior of JE if a boolean
EnvironmentConfig property is specified as "true" but with leading or trailing

<li>
The replay mechanism used in JE HA has been restructured to use multiple
threads for increased concurrency. These changes result in a 20% increase in
throughput in our performance tests. [#21396]
</li><br>

<li>
Made several improvements and fixes to log cleaning.
  <ul>
  <li>
  Made changes to reduce bursty cleaning behavior.  A burst of log cleaning
  would occur when selecting a log file for cleaning that has a significantly
  different average record size than the log files cleaned previously.  The
  bursts impacted application performance.
  </li>
  <li>
  EnvironmentStats.getCorrectedAvgLNSize and getEstimatedAvgLNSize are
  deprecated and have been replaced by getLNSizeCorrectionFactor.
  </li>
  <li>
  Added INFO level logging that is output during log cleaning and helps to
  analyze cleaner behavior.
  </li>
  <li>
  Fixed a problem that prevented the following EnvironmentStat values from
  being cleared (set to zero) when StatsConfig.setClear(true) was used:
  <code>getNBINDeltasObsolete, getNBINDeltasCleaned, getNBINDeltasDead,
  getNBINDeltasMigrated</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
  Fixed a stats problem that incorrectly counted migrated LNs as marked for
  migration, even when lazy migration was disabled (which is the default
  setting).  Migrated LNs were included in EnvironmentStats.getNLNsMarked and
  they should have been included in EnvironmentStats.getNLNsMigrated.
  </li>
  <li>
  Fixed a calculation error that prevented log cleaning probes (read-only
  cleaner runs that detect under-cleaning scenarios) from being executed.  The
  error occurred only when the log file size was very large, e.g., 1 GB.
  </li>
  </ul>
[#21106]
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug that sets the transaction state incorrectly when
InsufficientAcksException is thrown during Transaction.commit().  Due to this
bug, the transaction state is set to Transaction.State.MUST_ABORT when this
exception is thrown.  The incorrect state has two impacts:
  <ul>
  <li>
  If Transaction.abort() is <em>not</em> called after InsufficientAcksException
  is thrown, the impact is only that Transaction.getState() will report the
  wrong value (MUST_ABORT).  The transaction is committed on the master and
  will be committed on the replicas.
  </li>
  <li>
  If Transaction.abort() <em>is</em> called after InsufficientAcksException is
  thrown, the impact depends on whether Java assertions are enabled.  If
  assertions are enabled, abort() fires an assertion resulting in a stack trace
  such as the one below.  The transaction is committed on the master and will
  be committed on the replicas.
  <pre>
    Caused by: java.lang.AssertionError
    at com.sleepycat.je.txn.Txn.abortInternal(Txn.java:1127)
    at com.sleepycat.je.txn.Txn.abort(Txn.java:1094)
    at com.sleepycat.je.txn.Txn.abort(Txn.java:1067)
    at com.sleepycat.je.Transaction.abort(Transaction.java:205)
    ...
  </pre>
  If assertions are disabled and Transaction.abort() is called after
  InsufficientAcksException is thrown, the abort() will succeed (at least
  temporarily) on the master, but for a brief period (between the commit and
  the abort) may appear to other threads as committed.  It will always be
  committed on the replicas.  The abort() will be permanent on the master
  unless an abnormal shutdown and recovery occur and the transaction is
  replayed by recovery; in that case, the transaction will be committed on the
  master and the replicas.
  </li>
  </ul>
<p>
To summarize, if Transaction.abort() is called after InsufficientAcksException
is thrown and assertions are disabled, the transaction may be aborted on one
node (the master at the time of the commit and abort), but committed on the
other nodes (the replicas at the time).  Otherwise, the only impact is that the
transaction state will be wrong (it will be MUST_ABORT); in this case the
transaction will be committed on all nodes.
<p>
The likelihood of the bug occurring in production is low because the
InsufficientAcksException only occurs when a replica becomes unavailable in a
small window.  Normally, InsufficientReplicasException (which does not trigger
this bug) is thrown when a replica is unavailable.
<p>
This bug was introduced in JE 5.0.48 and only applies to replicated
environments.  With the fix, the transaction state is correctly set to
COMMITTED and the transaction will be committed on all nodes.
<p>
A workaround for this bug (an alternative to upgrading JE) is to be sure not to
call abort() after commit(), at least when InsufficientAcksException is thrown.
Calling abort() after commit() fails can make exception handling simpler, but
is never necessary.

<!-- =================================================== -->

<ol>

<li>
Fixed a bug that could cause the contents of a database to be deleted after a
crash, when the database was renamed just prior to the crash.  A database can
be renamed explicitly with <code>Environment.renameDatabase</code>, or
implicitly when a DPL <code>Renamer</code> mutation is used to rename an entity
class or a secondary key field.  This bug was introduced in JE 5.0.48. [#21537]
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed an inefficiency in the Checkpointer which manifests itself as
a large amount of time being spent in
<code>com.sleepycat.je.recovery.DirtyINMap.removeNextNode()</code> calling
<code>java.util.HashMap$HashIterator.remove()</code> calling
<code>java.util.HashMap.removeEntryForKey()</code>. [#21492]
</li><br>

<li>
An enhancement has been made to <code>DbVerify</code> to show a histogram of
BIN counts by utilization percentage.This is a sample of the output:
<pre>
Verifying database p10

        binCount=3,207
        binEntriesHistogram=[40-49%: 3,093; 50-59%: 10; 60-69%: 22; 70-79%: 26;

Fixed a bug that caused an exception such as the following, when opening an
Environment in read-only mode.  This occurred under certain circumstances when
a clean shutdown (final checkpoint) was not performed when the Environment was
last used by a read-write process.
<pre>

</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug in <code>JoinCursor</code> that causes records to be incorrectly
passed over (not returned) when the cursors are configured for read-uncommitted
isolation mode, and a non-null <code>data</code> parameter is passed to
<code>JoinCursor.getNext</code>.  Thanks to Arthur Brack for reporting this,
debugging it, and telling us how to fix it!  [#21501]
</li><br>

<li>
Made a minor performance improvement to avoid notifying the checkpointer that a
write has occurred, when the checkpointer is already running.  This wasted
overhead was sometimes noticeable in the internal
<code>com.sleepycat.je.recovery.Checkpointer.wakeupAfterWrite</code> method.
[#21106]
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug where a replication master could get an
<code>InsufficientAcksException</code> even if it had been configured
as Designated Primary, if it happened to lose the connection to the
replica in the middle of waiting for the commit acknowledgement.

<!-- =================================================== -->
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><u>Changes in 5.0.48</u></h3>
<!-- =================================================== -->

<ol>

<li>
Fixed a bug that caused an EnvironmentFailureException with LOG_FILE_NOT_FOUND,
for example:
<pre>
com.sleepycat.je.EnvironmentFailureException: Environment invalid because of previous exception:
(JE 5.0.34) fetchTarget of 0xc3d4/0x25dab parent IN=2372138 IN class=com.sleepycat.je.tree.IN
lastFullVersion=0xc4ca/0xd2aad lastLoggedVersion=0xc4ca/0xd2aad parent.getDirty()=false state=0
LOG_FILE_NOT_FOUND: Log file missing, log is likely invalid.
Environment is invalid and must be closed.
...</pre>
The bug occurred after deleting a range of keys in a deferred-write database
(DatabaseConfig.setDeferredWrite(true) or StoreConfig.setDeferredWrite(true)),
closing the Environment, and then opening the Environment.  It is most likely
to occur when deleting large numbers of consecutive keys, and when opening and
closing the Environment often, with the log cleaner enabled.
<p>
Because a log file is incorrectly deleted as a result of this bug, restoring
from a backup is necessary, i.e., there is no way to repair the environment.
Many thanks to Vishal Vishnoi and Vladimir Egorov for reproducing the problem
and helping us to diagnose it.
<p>
[#21348]
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug that caused an EnvironmentFailureException with LOG_FILE_NOT_FOUND,
for example:
<pre>
com.sleepycat.je.EnvironmentFailureException: Environment invalid because of previous exception:
(JE 5.0.34) fetchTarget of 0x1ced/0x3d3561b parent IN=116781 IN class=com.sleepycat.je.tree.BIN
lastFullVersion=0xbc40/0x2ca3f3a lastLoggedVersion=0xbcc3/0x6a37712 parent.getDirty()=false state=0
LOG_FILE_NOT_FOUND: Log file missing, log is likely invalid.
Environment is invalid and must be closed.
...</pre>
The bug occurred when a preload (Database.preload or Environment.preload) was
performed concurrently with other access to the database, including log
cleaning.  For example, the bug could occur as a result of the following
sequence:
<ul>
    <li>The Environment is opened with cleaner threads enabled, which is the
    default setting.</li>
    <li>The JE cleaner threads immediately start working and processing entries
    for Database X.  This is very likely to occur if the
    CLEANER_MIN_UTILIZATION setting has recently been increased, but can also
    occur without changing settings.</li>
    <li>After opening the Environment the application calls Database.preload or
    Environment.preload to preload Database X.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Because a log file is incorrectly deleted as a result of this bug, restoring
from a backup is necessary, i.e., there is no way to repair the environment.
We are in Diego's debt for not only <a href="https://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=2365156">reporting</a>
this bug on OTN, but for reproducing it repeatedly for us over an extended
period of debugging, and finally testing the fix.
<p>
[#21319]
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug that could cause Btree corruption for databases with the following
two characteristics:
<ul>
    <li>
    A key comparator must be configured.  A comparator is configured by calling
    <code>DatabaseConfig.setBtreeComparator</code> or
    <code>DatabaseConfig.setDuplicateComparator</code>, or by implementing the
    <code>Comparable</code> interface in a DPL key class.
    </li>
    <li>
    Key prefixing must be enabled.  Key prefixing is enabled by calling
    <code>DatabaseConfig.setKeyPrefixing(true)</code> and is enabled by default
    for all databases configured for duplicates.  A database is configured for
    duplicates explicitly using
    <code>DatabaseConfig.setSortedDuplicates(true)</code>, or implicitly using
    a DPL MANY_TO_XXX relationship (<code>Relationship.MANY_TO_ONE</code> or
    <code>Relationship.MANY_TO_MANY</code>).
</ul>
The corruption causes corrupted keys, and could manifest itself in a number
of ways.  For example, the comparator could throw an exception because the key
is invalid, an operation could fail unexpectedly because the key is not found,
internal operations such as log cleaning could fail, etc.
<p>
Thanks to Lee Saenz and the other folks at UnboundId for reporting this problem
and reproducing it repeatedly for us during debugging.

</li><br>

<li>
The following change log entry applies to the JE 4.1 product, but impacts the
upgrade process from JE 4.1 to JE 5.0.
<p>
Fixed a bug in the DbPreUpgrade_4_1 and DbRepPreUpgrade_4_1 utilities that
prevented them from working properly due to concurrent log cleaning activity
while the utility is running.  The symptom of the bug is that, after running
the utility without errors, when then opening the Environment with JE 5, the
following exception would occur:
  <pre>
  com.sleepycat.je.EnvironmentFailureException: (JE 5.0.XX) Before upgrading to
  JE 5.0, the following utility must be run using JE 4.1: DbPreUpgrade_4_1
  using the JE old version. See the release notes.
  </pre>
WARNING: Due to this bug, JE 4.1.20 or later should be used to run the
DbPreUpgrade_4_1 and DbRepPreUpgrade_4_1 utilities.  In addition, these
utilities should be run for all environments, not just those with duplicates
databases. See "Upgrade Procedure" above for information on running these
utilities.

</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug that could cause unnecessary log cleaning when upgrading to JE 5.
It could also cause an exception after upgrading such as the one below, when a
Btree comparator is configured in a duplicates database:

</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug that could cause <code>Environment.removeDatabase</code> or
<code>truncateDatabase</code> to loop in a "livelock" pattern along with active
log cleaner threads, where the <code>removeDatabase</code> or
<code>truncateDatabase</code> thread is not making forward progress.  Also fix
a bug that could cause this state to eventually cause an
<code>EnvironmentFailureException</code> during a subsequent recovery, and
prevent opening the environment.  [#20816]
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug that could cause a call
to <code>Environment.checkpoint</code>
or <code>Environment.close</code> to hang with the following stack
trace. The can only happen in a replicated environment, and the most
realistic situation that could provoke this is a call to
Environment.close() while there are ongoing, concurrent write
operations.

<li>
It is now possible to specify the receive buffer size to be used
TCP connections used by JE HA:
<ul>
<li>
The
<code>com.sleepycat.je.rep.ReplicationConfig.REPLICA_RECEIVE_BUFFER_SIZE</code>
parameter controls the buffer size of the TCP connection used to communicate changes
between a replica and its master.
</li>
<li>The <code>setReceiveBufferSize(int)</code> and
<code>getReceiveBufferSize()</code> methods of the class
<code>com.sleepycat.je.rep.NetworkRestore</code> are used when copying
log files between replication nodes for Network Restore.
</li></ul>
<br>
The new default value associated with TCP connections is 1MB and
provides good performance on most platforms. The 1MB default value represents a
change in behavior from previous versions of JE where the buffer size was
defaulted to that provided by the underlying OS. To continue using the old
behavior specify a value of zero for the buffer size. Please consult the javadoc
for further details. [#21002]
</li><br>

<li>
Fix a DPL bug that prevented upgrading to JE 5.0 from an earlier release.  The
bug applies only when a stored entity, written with an older release, is
present and meets the following qualifications:
<ul>
    <li>The entity has a non-key field declared as type Object but containing a
    String, and</li>
    <li>this non-key field contains the same object (same String instance) as
    the primary key field.</li>
</ul>
When such an entity was read with JE 5.0, an AssertionError was thrown, for
example:

</li><br>

<li>
Add additional fixes to prevent looping and long operations times for
<code>Environment.removeDatabase</code> and <code>truncateDatabase</code> (see
[#20816] above).  The additional fixes address long operation times due to log
cleaning with large file sizes in combination with eviction.  Also fix a bug
that slows down log cleaning (contributing to the long operation times as well)
when large numbers of databases are present, and not all databases are kept
open by the application.  [#21015]
</li><br>

<li>
Fix a bug that caused a NullPointerException such as the following (or a
similar exception) during periods of heavy concurrent eviction.

<li>
In general BDB JE is not sensitive to the JVM default encoding and all text --
both in stored data and in network protocols -- is encoded as UTF-8.  However,
several exceptions to this rule have been discovered and are addressed in this
patch release.
<ul>
    <li>
    For HA apps, host and node names in the replication network protocol are
    currently encoded using the JVM default encoding.  A new configuration
    parameter (ReplicationConfig.PROTOCOL_OLD_STRING_ENCODING) can be set to
    false to use UTF-8 encoding instead.  In the next JE release this parameter
    will be set to false by default, and we strongly recommend that all
    impacted applications explicitly set it to false before then.  See the
    parameter javadoc for more information, including a definition of which
    applications are impacted and restrictions on performing a hot upgrade.
    </li>
    <li>
    The DbPrintLog utility has been changed to assume UTF-8 encoding of keys
    when the "-k text" option is used.  Previously it assumed the default
    encoding.  Since key-values are normally portable, UTF-8 is a better
    assumption.
    </li>
    <li>
    When DbDump is used in aggressive salvage mode (-R), a bug was fixed where
    database names were assumed to be stored internally in default encoding,
    when actually they are stored in UTF-8 encoding.  If the default encoding
    and UTF-8 do not match, for the characters in the database name, then
    DbDump would fail.
    </li>
    <li>
    Several issues were fixed in unit tests that causes failures when run with
    a JVM default encoding that is not a superset of ASCII.
    </li>
</ul>
[#20967]
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug where JE internal threads throw UnsupportedOperationException on a
JVM where CPU time measurement is not supported by the
java.lang.management.ThreadMXBean implementation.  For example, this is not
supported in the IBM JVM for z/OS.  [#20967]
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug where the following exception could be thrown during heavy
concurrent write and read operations.  This did not cause data loss and did not
invalidate the Environment instance.

<li>
The configuration parameters:
<code>ReplicationConfig.REPLAY_MAX_OPEN_DB_HANDLES</code> and
<code>ReplicationConfig.REPLAY_DB_HANDLE_TIMEOUT</code> have been
deprecated. Please use the mutable configuration parameters:
<code>ReplicationMutableConfig.REPLAY_MAX_OPEN_DB_HANDLE</code> and
<code>ReplicationMutableConfig.REPLAY_DB_HANDLE_TIMEOUT</code> instead. This
change also fixes a bug which resulted in the values associated with these
parameters being used incorrectly.
[#21144]

<li>
Fix a DPL bytecode generation issue related to Java 1.7 by upgrading the DPL
bytecode generator to use ASM 4.0.  Previously, if the DPL were compiled for
the Java 1.7 bytecode target, an exception such as the following would occur
when running the application:
<pre>

</pre>
This issue did not normally arise when using a downloaded JE jar file, because
the JE library is compiled with a Java 1.5 bytecode target.  It would arise,
however, if JE were explicitly compiled with a Java 1.7 bytecode target, or
with Java 1.7 and no specified target.  A workaround for this issue was to
specify -XX:-UseSplitVerifier when running Java; this is no longer necessary.

configured.  [#21177]
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug that caused an erroneous SecondaryIntegrityException to be thrown,
or an OperationStatus.KEYEXIST to be returned, when using a JoinCursor with
READ_UNCOMMITTED isolation.  The erroneous exception or return value occurred
when performing reads using the JoinCursor concurrently with updates or
deletions of the same records.  [#21258]
</li><br>

<li>
Change Database.close and Transaction.abort so they fail silently when called
after already being closed/aborted/committed, and the Environment is invalid
due to an earlier EnvironmentFailureException.  Previously, an
EnvironmentFailureException was thrown under these conditions.  The new
behavior is consistent with Cursor.close and avoids unnecessary exception
handling.  [#21264]

  <li>Previously an XAException was thrown if the transaction was not
  suspended.  This is no longer the case.</li>
  <li>XAException is thrown when TMSUSPEND is passed and the transaction
  is already suspended.</li>
  <li>XAException is thrown if the Xid is unknown.</li>
  <li>XAException is thrown if TMSUCCESS, TMFAIL or TMSUSPEND is not
  passed.</li>
  </ul>
[#21309]
</li><br>

<li>
Added the <code>Transaction.getState()</code> method and
<code>Transaction.State</code> enumeration to formalize the different states of
a transaction, and in particular to indicate whether a transaction commit is in
an undetermined state (<code>Transaction.State.POSSIBLY_COMMITTED</code>) when
a failure occurs during the commit process.  Also added an internal pre-flight
check, just before making a commit durable, to narrow the time window where the
<code>Transaction.State.POSSIBLY_COMMITTED</code> state can occur.  See the new
javadoc for more details.  [#21264]
</li><br>

<li>
Exposed an environment configuration parameter that was previously
undocumented: <code>EnvironmentConfig.EVICTOR_CRITICAL_PERCENTAGE</code>.  This
parameter can be set to improve operation latency under certain conditions.
See the javadoc for more information.
<p>
Also improved eviction to avoid acquiring a per-database exclusive latch for
each Btree node that is evicted.  This appeared in thread dumps as follows:

Log all RuntimeExceptions (not only DatabaseExceptions) when the
Environment.cleanLog method is called.  Previously, RuntimeExceptions were
logged when the built-in cleaner thread was used, but not when cleanLog was
called directly.  Also ensure that when a RuntimeException is thrown by a
user's key or duplicate comparator, the exception does not prevent latches from
being properly released.  [#21328]

<h3 align="center"><u>Changes in 5.0.34</u></h3>
<!-- =================================================== -->

<h3><a name="Features">New Features:</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
A new class, DiskOrderedCursor has been added which lets an
application iterate over records in a Database in unsorted order, in
order to improve retrieval speed. This can be useful when the
application needs to scan all records in a database, and will be
applying filtering logic which does not need key ordered
retrieval. The cursor optimizes the iteration by walking in Log
Sequence Number (LSN) order rather than key order. LSN order
approximates disk sector order, and retrieving in disk order reduces
I/O cost.
<p>
A DiskOrderedCursor can be obtained via
<code>Database.openCursor(DiskOrderedCursorConfig)</code>. Note that
creating an instance of the DiskOrderedCursor disables the file
deletion done by log cleaning until the <code>close()</code> method
has been called. See the javadoc for DiskOrderedCursor for more
detailed information. [#15260]
</li><br>

<li>
A new <code>Environment.preload(Databases[], PreloadConfig)</code>
method has been added which permits preloading multiple databases
via a single method call rather than multiple calls
to <code>Database.preload()</code>.
Preload is implemented to optimize I/O cost by fetching the records of a Database by disk
order, so that disk access is are sequential rather than
random. Using the multi-database <code>Environment.preload()</code>
lets the preload operation batch
the records for all of the target Databases so that
multiple scans over the log are not necessary.
<p>
A progress mechanism has also been added which lets a caller of
the <code>preload()</code> method receive feedback on whether progress
is being made.  See
<code>com.sleepycat.je.ProgressListener</code> and
<code>com.sleepycat.je.PreloadConfig.setProgressListener()</code>.
<p>
Two new configurations are available to bound the amount of memory
used by preload processing, at the expense of preload
performance. <code>com.sleepycat.je.PreloadConfig.setLSNBatchSize()</code>
can be used to direct preload to partition its work into batches., In
addition, <code>com.sleepycat.je.PreloadConfig.setInternalMemoryLimit()</code>
can be used to limit the amount of memory outside of the JE cache used
by preload.
[#15260] [#18153] [#19306]
</li><br>

<li>
The JE environment can now be spread across multiple subdirectories.
Environment subdirectories may be used to spread an environment's
*.jdb files over multiple directories, and therefore over multiple
disks or file systems.  Environment subdirectories reside in the
environment home directory and are named data001/ through dataNNN/,
consecutively, where NNN is the value of je.log.nDataDirectories.  A
typical configuration would be to have each of the dataNNN/ names be
symbolic links to actual directories which each reside on separate
file systems or disks.
<p>
Environment subdirectories are enabled through
the <code>je.log.nDataDirectories</code> environment parameter.  If 0
(the default), all log files (*.jdb) will reside in the environment
home directory passed to the Environment constructor.  A non zero
value indicates the number of environment subdirectories to use for
holding the environment's log files.
<p>
If data subdirectories are used (i.e. je.log.nDataDirectories > 0),
this parameter must be set when the environment is initially created.
Like the environment home directory, each and every one of the
dataNNN/ subdirectories must also be present and writable.  This
parameter must be set to the same value for all subsequent openings of
the environment or an exception will be thrown.
<p>
If the set of existing dataNNN/ subdirectories is not equivalent to
the set { 1 ... je.log.nDataDirectories } when the environment is
opened, an EnvironmentFailureException will be thrown, and the
Environment will fail to be opened.
<p>
<code>DbBackup.getLogFilesInBackupSet()</code> now returns the subdirectory
name and file separator prepended to the file name if
je.log.nDataDirectories > 0. [#19125]
</li><br>

<li>
A new class, com.sleepycat.je.rep.AppStateMonitor lets the HA
application add more application specific information to the notion of
node state in a replication group. It's meant to support more
application specific semantics when assessing the availability of a
given node member. [#18046]
</li><br>

<li>
New options have been added for changing the host of a JE replication
node, and for moving a JE replication group. See the Utilities section.
</li><br>

<li>
Applications may now specify a custom java.util.logging.Handler per
Environment. Logging messages generated by JE will go to this
handler. See EnvironmentConfig.setLoggingHandler() and the
memo <a href="traceLogging.html">Using JE trace logging</a>. [#19110]
</li><br>

<li>
Replicated nodes can now be opened in UNKNOWN state, to support read
only operations in a replicated system when a master is not
available. Prior to JE 5, replicated nodes could only be opened in
MASTER or REPLICA state, and if a master could not be elected, the
node could not be opened. This is enabled through the new
configuration parameter: ReplicationConfig.ENV_UNKNOWN_STATE_TIMEOUT.
Please review its javadoc for further details.
[#19338]
</li><br>

<li>
The master node in a replication group now rebroadcasts election
results on a periodic basis, to help restore normal functioning of a
replication group after a network partition has been resolved. The
default period is a minute and can be modified by the new
ReplicationConfig parameter
ReplicationConfig.ELECTIONS_REBROADCAST_PERIOD. Please review its
javadoc for further details. [#20220]
</li> <br>

<li>
A new listener mechanism is available to give the application feedback
about potentially long running activities such as environment startup
(recovery), replication stream syncup, and database preload. See
com.sleepycat.je.ProgressListener and its related enums,
com.sleepycat.je.RecoveryProgress, com.sleepycat.je.rep.SyncupProgress
and com.sleepycat.je.PreloadConfig.Phases. [#20043]
</li><br>

<li>
New methods were added to allow quickly skipping over a specified number of
key/value pairs using a cursor.  For details, see the javadoc for
<code>Cursor.skipNext</code> and <code>Cursor.skipPrev</code>.  [#19165]
</li><br>

<li>
A per-Environment ClassLoader may now be configured and will be used by JE for
loading all user-supplied classes, including btree comparators, duplicate
comparators, class instances serialized by SerialBinding, and DPL persistent
classes.  This is useful when separate ClassLoaders are used for the JE jar
file and the application's classes, for example, when running under an
application server framework.  The ClassLoader is configured using
<code>EnvironmentConfig.setClassLoader</code>.  Related changes are:
  <ul>
      <li>The new <code>com.sleepycat.util.ClassResolver</code> class defines
      and implements the class loading policy.</li>

      <li>If a btree or duplicated comparator needs to be initialized before it
      is used or needs access to the environment's ClassLoader property, it may
      implement the new <code>com.sleepycat.je.DatabaseComparator</code>
      interface.</li>

      <li>The <code>com.sleepycat.bind.serial.Catalog</code> interface has a
      new method, <code>getClassLoader</code>, that is used to supply the
      ClassLoader to the <code>SerialBinding</code>.  This method is
      implemented by the <code>StoredClassCatalog</code> class, and returns
      the environment's ClassLoader property.  As a result,
      <code>SerialBinding.getClassLoader</code> now returns the environment's
      ClassLoader property.
      </li>

      <li>The <code>com.sleepycat.persist.model.EntityModel.classForName</code>
      static method has been deprecated in favor of the new
      <code>EntityModel.resolveClass</code> method, which honors the
      environment's ClassLoader property.</li>
  </ul>
[#18368]
</li><br>

<li>
The <code>java.io.Closeable</code> interface is now implemented by all JE
classes and interfaces with a <code>public void close()</code> method.  This
allows using these objects with the Java 1.7 try-with-resources statement, for
applications compiled and run with Java 1.7 or later.  See
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/AutoCloseable.html">AutoCloseable</a>,
which is a superinterface of <code>java.io.Closeable</code> in Java 1.7.

<li>
The <code>Environment.flushLog</code> method has been added. It can be used to
make durable, by writing to the log, all preceding non-transactional write
operations, as well as any preceding transactions that were committed with
no-sync durability.  To flush buffered data for durability reasons, with the
addition of this method it is no longer necessary to perform a checkpoint, call
<code>Environment.sync</code>, or commit a transaction (with sync or
write-no-sync durability).  [#19111]

<h3><a name="API">API Changes:</a></h3>
<ol>

<li>
Made the EnvironmentConfig and ReplicationConfig classes Serializable. [#19241]
</li><br>

<li>
The <code>je.env.fairLatches</code> environment parameter has been deprecated
and no longer has any effect.
</li><br>

<li>
The behavior, although not the syntax or intent, of
<code>EnvironmentConfig.CHECKPOINTER_BYTES_INTERVAL</code> has changed.
Previously, this interval defined the byte distance between the end of one
checkpoint and the start of the next.  Now it defines the byte distance between
the start of one checkpoint and start of the next.  In other words, now the
interval includes the checkpoint itself, which in some cases can be large.
This now more accurately reflects the intention of the parameter, which is to
bound the recovery interval, which is proportional to the time to recover (open
the <code>Environment</code>) after a crash.  It does mean, however, that
checkpoints may occur more often for the same configured interval, and some
applications may wish to adjust their configured setting accordingly.  [#19704]
</li><br>

<li>
<code>Cursor.getSearchBothRange</code> for a non-duplicates database has been
corrected to behave exactly as <code>Cursor.getSearchBoth</code>.  Previously
<code>getSearchBothRange</code> returned a data item that was greater or equal
to the data search parameter, which was incorrect.  Now it only returns a data
item that is equal to the data search parameter.  [#19165]
</li><br>

<li>
See the description of the new ProgressListener class in the New
Features section above.
</li><br>

<li>
The default value for <code>EnvironmentConfig.CLEANER_LAZY_MIGRATION</code> has
been changed from true to false.  Over several releases the benefits of setting
this to true have decreased and are now less than the benefits of setting it to
false.  See the javadoc for this parameter for details.  [#20588]
</li>
</ol>

<!-- ================================================= -->
<h3><a name="General">Performance and other General Changes</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
Performance of record update and deletion operations has been significantly
improved when the record is not in the JE cache and the application does not
need to read the record prior to performing the update or deletion.
Previously, the old version of the record was always read into cache, if not
already present, by the update or deletion operation.  If the record was not
already in cache, this often resulted in an expensive random I/O.  Now, because
of internal changes to record locking, records are not read by update or
deletion operations, and this can significantly reduce random I/O for delete or
update-heavy workloads.  An exception to this rule is when a record is updated
or deleted in a primary database that has associated secondary indices.  In
this case, the primary record must be read in order to update the secondary
indices.
<p>
As a result of this change, the log cleaner must now sometimes estimate the
size of records that are made obsolete by updates and deletions, and must
sometimes "probe" a log file to determine record sizes.  Several statistics
have been added to show this activity in the
<code>com.sleepycat.je.EnvironmentStats</code> class:
<ul>
    <li><code>getCorrectedAvgLNSize</code></li>
    <li><code>getEstimatedAvgLNSize</code></li>
    <li><code>getNCleanerProbeRuns</code></li>
</ul>
The <code>DbSpace</code> utility now also prints the first two of these new
statistics.
<p>
[#18633]
</li><br>

<li>
Made an internal format change for databases with duplicate keys that improves
operation performance, reduces memory and disk overhead, and increases
concurrency.  The format change requires that databases configured for
duplicates (including DPL secondary keys with a MANY_TO_XXX relationship)
created with JE 4.1 or earlier must be converted to the new duplicates format.
The conversion is done automatically when first opening the environment with JE
5.0.  The conversion is described in the Upgrade Procedure section at the top
of this page.
<p>
<em>Internal Format Change</em>
<p>
This information is included for users who understand Btree internals and wish
to know what changed internally.
<ul>
    <li>
    Previously, for each unique key in a database with duplicates, a separate
    Btree for that key was used to store the duplicates for that key.  In
    addition, a leaf node (record) per key was stored to hold the duplicate
    count.  The separate Btree was found to add unnecessary memory and disk
    overhead, and the maintenance of the duplicate count was found to decrease
    concurrency.  The new format does not use a separate Btree per key, and
    instead uses an internal two-part key. A duplicate count per key is no
    longer stored or maintained.
    </li>
    <li>
    The first part of the new internal two-part key is the user key and the
    second part is the user data.  JE translates between the internal key and
    the user key and data, and adapts the get, put, etc, API operations to work
    with new internal key format.  To reduce memory overhead, key prefixing is
    always enabled for databases with duplicates.  Note that in a database with
    duplicates, the internal data size is always zero because the user data is
    stored as the second part of the internal key.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Performance Improvements</em>
<ul>
    <li>
    The size of the reduction in memory and disk overhead depends on how many
    duplicates for each key are present.  The improvement is largest when the
    number of duplicates per key is small.  For example, in a data set of 10
    million records, 10 duplicates per key, and 8 byte key and 8 byte data
    lengths, the total memory and disk usage are reduced by approximately 40%.
    Operation performance is improved as a side effect of this reduced
    overhead.  For larger numbers of duplicates per key the improvement will be
    smaller, and vice-versa.
    </li>
    <li>
    The increase in concurrency applies when records are inserted and deleted.
    Previously, when one transaction performed an insertion or deletion of a
    duplicate for a given key, until this transaction ended no other
    transaction could read or write to any other duplicate for that key.  Now,
    other transactions are prevented only from accessing the specific duplicate
    that was inserted or deleted, according to the isolation mode in use.  The
    degree of increased concurrency depends on how many transactions/threads
    access duplicates for the same key.  In general the impact will be larger
    when there are more duplicates per key.
    </li>
    <li>
    Operation performance is also improved during reads, when the cache size is
    not large enough to hold all LNs or the cache is cold.  Previously, the
    leaf node for each duplicate was read from disk when not already in cache.
    Now, leaf nodes are not read from disk during a normal read operation and
    therefore random I/O is reduced.  For the data set described above (10
    million records, 10 duplicates per key, 8 byte key and data), loaded in
    random key order, when starting with a cold cache the duration of a full
    scan in key order was improved by approximately 800%.  This is a worst case
    test scenario for the old duplicate format, and the improvement will be
    smaller in tests with different parameters.
</ul>
<p>
<em>Other Behavioral Changes</em>
<ul>
    <li>
    Without key prefixing, databases with duplicates would store keys
    inefficiently.  Therefore, key prefixing is now mandatory and automatically
    enabled for all databases with duplicates.  When duplicates are configured,
    the application does not have to call
    <code>DatabaseConfig.setKeyPrefixing(true)</code>.  If
    <code>DatabaseConfig.setKeyPrefixing(false)</code> is called for a database
    with duplicates configured, an <code>IllegalStateException</code> is
    thrown.
    </li>
    <li>
    With this change, determining the number of duplicates per key
    (<code>Cursor.count</code>) is more costly than it was previously.
    Previously, the count was stored and could be returned by reading a single
    record for the key.  Now, to determine the count precisely JE must traverse
    internal Btree nodes to count the duplicates for the key.  If you are using
    <code>Cursor.count</code>, consider using the new method
    <code>Cursor.countEstimate</code> instead.
    <code>Cursor.countEstimate</code> returns a rough estimate of the count
    using a fixed cost algorithm. Since <code>Cursor.count</code> is primarily
    intended for use in query optimizations, the
    <code>Cursor.countEstimate</code> method may be a good substitute.  For
    example, <code>JoinCursor</code> now uses <code>Cursor.countEstimate</code>
    rather than <code>Cursor.count</code> to determine the index processing
    order.  Likewise, <code>EntityCursor.countEstimate</code> is a potential
    substitute for <code>EntityCursor.count</code>.  </li>
    <li>
    Btree partial comparators may now be used with databases configured for
    duplicates.  See <code>DatabaseConfig.setBtreeComparator</code> for
    information on partial comparators.  Previously, Btree partial comparators
    could be use only with non-duplicate databases.
    </li>
    <li>
    The following methods are deprecated and no longer have any effect, or in
    the case of getter methods, now always return zero or null.
    <ul>
        <li><code>DatabaseConfig.setNodeMaxDupTreeEntries</code></li>
        <li><code>DatabaseConfig.getNodeMaxDupTreeEntries</code></li>
        <li><code>BtreeStats.getDuplicateBottomInternalNodeCount</code></li>
        <li><code>BtreeStats.getDupCountLeafNodeCount</code></li>
        <li><code>BtreeStats.getDuplicateInternalNodeCount</code></li>
        <li><code>BtreeStats.getDuplicateTreeMaxDepth</code></li>
        <li><code>BtreeStats.getDINsByLevel</code></li>
        <li><code>BtreeStats.getDBINsByLevel</code></li>
        <li><code>PreloadStats.getNDINsLoaded</code></li>
        <li><code>PreloadStats.getNDBINsLoaded</code></li>
        <li><code>PreloadStats.getNDupCountLNsLoaded</code></li>
    </ul>
</ul>
[#19165]
</li><br>

<li>
An improvement has been made that requires significantly less writing per
checkpoint, less writing during eviction, and less metadata overhead in the JE
on-disk log files.
<p>
Previously, delta log entries for bottom internal nodes, called BINDeltas, were
written by checkpoints rather than writing full BINs, and full BINs were
written less frequently (see <code>EnvironmentConfig.TREE_MAX_DELTA</code> and
<code>TREE_BIN_DELTA </code>).  This is still the case.  However, the approach
taken previously required that the same delta information be repeatedly written
at each checkpoint, even it had not changed since the last checkpoint.  Now,
delta information is only written when it changes.
<p>
By significantly reducing writing, the new approach provides overall
performance improvements.  However, there is also an additional cost to the new
approach: When a BIN is not in cache, fetching the BIN now often requires two
random reads instead of just one; one read to fetch the BINDelta and another to
fetch the last full BIN.  For applications where all active BINs fit in cache,
this adds to the I/O cost of initially populating the cache.  For applications
where active BINs do not fit in cache, this adds to the per-operation cost of
fetching a record (an LN) when its parent BIN is not in cache.  In our tests,
the lower write rate more than compensates for the additional I/O of fetching
the BINDelta, but the benefit is greatest when all BINs fit in cache.
<p>
[#19671]
</li><br>

<li>
Improvements were made to recovery (Environment open) performance by changing
the behavior of checkpoints in certain cases.  Recovery should always be very
quick after the following types of checkpoints:
  <ul>
  <li>When <code>CheckpointConfig.setMinimizeRecoveryTime(true)</code> is used
  along with an explicit checkpoint performed by calling the
  <code>Environment.checkpoint</code> method.</li>
  <li>When <code>Environment.sync</code> is called.</li>
  <li>When <code>Environment.close</code> is called, since it performs a final
  checkpoint.</li>
  </ul>
In addition, a problem was fixed where periodic checkpoints (performed by the
checkpointer thread or by calling <code>Environment.checkpoint</code>) would
cause long recovery times under certain circumstances.
<p>
As a part of this work, the actions invoked by
ReplicatedEnvironment.shutdownGroup() were streamlined to use the
setMinimizeRecoveryTime() option and to reduce spurious timeouts
during the shutdown processing.  [#19559]
</li><br>

<li>
Node fanouts (see <code>DatabaseConfig.setNodeMaxEntries</code>s) are now
mutable and persistent database attributes. They were previously permitted to
mutate, but the changed attribute value wasn't saved persistently, so the new
value might sometimes revert to the previously existing setting. This has been
fixed.  In addition, the javadoc for DatabaseConfig has been expanded to
clarify what attributes are mutable vs. fixed, persistent vs temporary.
[#18262]
</li><br>

<li>
The internal Database ID field has been enlarged from a 32-bit (int) quantity
to a 64-bit (long) quantity.  A Database ID value is assigned from a single
sequence in each Environment for each Database created and truncated.  This
change therefore increases the total number of Databases that can be created
and the number of truncate operations that can be performed over the lifetime
of an Environment.  Note that one bit of the ID is used to distinguish
replicated from local databases, so the total number of Databases and truncate
operations per Environment is now effectively 2^63.  [#18540]

<li>
The JE HA Monitor, com.sleepycat.je.rep.monitor.Monitor is now more
proactive about discovering group status changes that occur while it
is has no network connectivity. The monitor could miss replication
group changes if it was down, or isolated due to a network
partition. In JE 4.1, the Monitor would not receive that information,
and would not be able to alert the application. In JE 5, the Monitor
periodically and proactively checks replication group status in order
to update its own notion of group status, and will send the
appropriate notifications to the application.
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a problem arising from a network partition event, that would
result in an unnecessary rollback of committed transactions. This
problem typically manifests itself in the application receiving a
RollbackProhibitedException if the number of transactions exceeds
je.rep.txnRollbackLimit. The following describes a scenario leading to
the problem:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Consider a three node replication group: A, B, C with A as the
master and nodes: B, C serving as replicas. </li>
<li> A network partition isolates A from B and C, resulting in
the partitions: (A) and (B,C).</li>
<li> B and C hold and election and B becomes the master.</li>
<li> There are now two masters: the pre-existing A which is isolated
and cannot perform durable writes, and a newly elected B.</li>
<li> The majority side (B,C) is accessible and continues to make
progress performing durable writes.</li>
<li> The master on the majority side B goes down. There is now no
master on the (B,C) side since there is no quorum. </li>
<li> Some time later, the partition is healed. </li>
<li> C now sees A as an established master and syncs with it
potentially rolling back committed transactions as a result.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The fix changes the final step above so that an election is held
before the rollback is allowed to proceed. The election results in C
being elected the new master. Node A encounters a
MasterReplicaTransitionException which it must handle by
closing and re-opening its environment handle so it can resume
operations as a replica. [#20258] [#20572]
</li><br>

<li>
Fix a bug where a temporary database record was unnecessarily locked during log
cleaning, and this also caused an assertion to fire in
<code>FileProcessor.processFoundLN</code>. This only occurs when temporary

to false, which is now the default in JE 5.  [#20670]

Fix a bug where key prefixing (<code>DatabaseConfig.setKeyPrefixing</code>) was
not effective when keys are inserted in sequential order, for example, during a
bulk load in key order.  Without any updates, deletions or non-sequential
insertions, the prefix information was not persistent and therefore not used
after closing and re-opening the Environment.  In addition, during sequential
insertion more cache space than necessary was used under certain circumstances.
These problems did not occur with non-sequential insertion.  [#20799]
</li><br>

<li>
Improved <code>DbCacheSize</code> utility to take into account memory
management enhancements and improve accuracy. Added support for key prefixing
(<code>-keyprefix</code>), databases configured for sorted duplicates
(<code>-duplicates</code>), and replicated environments
(<code>-replicated</code>).  Environment config params and replication config
params may also be specified, since they impact memory usage as well.
<p>
The old <code>-density</code> argument has been replaced by
<code>-orderedinsertion</code>.  The old <code>-overhead</code> argument has
been removed, and the utility prints the minimum environment memory overhead.

</li><br>

<li>
Two bindings for the <code>java.math.BigDecimal</code> data type are now
available.
<ul>
    <li>The sorted format allows using <code>BigDecimal</code> values in record
    keys, and provides natural sort order without a custom comparator.  The API
    additions are:</li>
    <ul>
        <li><code>com.sleepycat.bind.tuple.SortedBigDecimalBinding</code> -- new class</li>
        <li><code>com.sleepycat.bind.tuple.TupleInput</code> -- new methods: <code>readSortedBigDecimal, getSortedBigDecimalByteLength</code>.</li>
        <li><code>com.sleepycat.bind.tuple.TupleOutput</code> -- new methods: <code>writeSortedBigDecimal, getSortedBigDecimalMaxByteLength</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The unsorted <code>BigDecimal</code> format does not provide natural
    sort order and is not intended for use in record keys, but has two
    advantages over the sorted format: trailing zeros after the decimal place
    are preserved, and a more compact, faster serialization format is used.
    The API additions are:</li>
    <ul>
        <li><code>com.sleepycat.bind.tuple.BigDecimalBinding</code> -- new class</li>
        <li><code>com.sleepycat.bind.tuple.TupleInput</code> -- new methods: <code>readBigDecimal, getBigDecimalByteLength</code>.</li>

    </ul>
</ul>

overview of the new bindings and a comparative description of all tuple
bindings.  [#18379]</p>
</li><br>

<li>
<code>java.math.BigDecimal</code> is now defined as a built-in DPL simple data
type.  This means that <code>BigDecimal</code> values may be stored in DPL
persistent objects, and fields of type <code>BigDecimal</code> may be defined
as primary or secondary keys.  The sorted <code>BigDecimal</code> format is
always used in the DPL, and this provides natural sort order without a custom
comparator.  However, trailing zeros after the decimal place are stripped,
meaning that precision is not preserved.</p>
<p>If the application has previously defined a <code>PersistentProxy</code> for
<code>BigDecimal</code>, special considerations are necessary when upgrading
to this release:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    The call to <code>EntityModel.registerClass</code> for the
    <code>BigDecimal</code> proxy class must be removed.  If it is not removed,
    an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> will be thrown by the
    <code>EntityStore</code> constructor.  In general, proxies for built-in
    simple types are not allowed.
    </li>
    <li>
    Even though the <code>BigDecimal</code> proxy class is not registered, the
    proxy class must be available for reading <code>BigDecimal</code> values
    that were written via the proxy, prior to this release.
    Rewriting (updating) an entity will convert the proxied
    <code>BigDecimal</code> value to the new built-in <code>BigDecimal</code>
    format.  To convert all entities explicitly and efficiently, the
    <code>EntityStore.evolve</code> method may be used.
    After converting all entities using the proxied values, if you additionally
    wish to remove the proxy class itself then you must supply a
    <code>Deleter</code> mutation for the proxy class.
    </li>
    <li>
    To use such a field, that was previously stored via a
    <code>BigDecimal</code> proxy class, as a secondary key, the application
    must first explicitly evolve the index using
    <code>EntityStore.evolve</code>, or update all values.  Then the
    <code>@SecondaryKey</code> annotation may be added to create a new
    secondary index.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>[#18379]</p>
</li><br>

<li>
Thanks to a contribution from Dave Brosius, a built-in proxy has been added for
the <code>java.util.LinkedHashMap</code>. <code>LinkedHashMap</code> may now be
used as the type of any persistent field. [#20055]
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a problem with <code>MANY_TO_ONE</code> and <code>MANY_TO_MANY</code>
secondary index ordering when a <code>Comparable</code> key class is used for
the primary key.

<p>In general, for <code>MANY_TO_ONE</code> and <code>MANY_TO_MANY</code>
secondary indexes, more than one entity may have the same secondary key.  When
iterating over entities in secondary key order, the ordering of entities is by
primary key within secondary key.  For example, if Employee entities with an
integer ID primary key are iterated using a String department secondary key,
the iteration order is by integer ID within (grouped by) department.</p>

<p>In prior releases, when a <code>Comparable</code> key class is used for the
primary key, the <code>Comparable</code> defines the order of entities in the
primary index.  However, the <code>Comparable.compareTo</code> method is not
used to determine primary key ordering within secondary key.  Instead, the
natural order of the primary keys is used.  In our example, if the primary key
class implements <code>Comparable</code> to order entities in decreasing
integer order, the iteration order is incorrectly in natural integer order
(increasing) within department.  This has been fixed and the order for newly
created secondary indexes now uses the <code>Comparable</code>, and in our
example the iteration order is now decreasing integer order within
department.</p>

<p>However, because the ordering of an existing index cannot be changed, the
old ordering will apply for secondary indexes created prior to this release.
To cause the correct ordering to be used for an existing index, you must
delete the database for the secondary index.  The next time the index is
opened (via <code>EntityStore.getSecondaryIndex</code>) the index will be
regenerated in the correct order.  To delete the index database, first
determine the database name; see the Database Names section of the
<code>EntityStore</code> javadoc.  Then, before opening the
<code>EntityStore</code>, delete the index database using
<code>Environment.removeDatabase</code>. [#17252]

The performance of serializing/deserializing String data in DPL has
been improved by treating String type as a primitive type.  Treating
String type as a primitive type in DPL does not need to stored the
format ID, and directly uses
TupleInput.readString/TupleOutput.writeString to serialize/deserialize
String data.
<p>
In our benchmark, there are 500,000 records containing only String
fields, and the size of each record is 180 bytes. With such changes,
the reading performance gains 14% improvement, and the writing
performance gains 10% improvement. [#19247]
</p>
</li><br>

<li>
PrimaryIndex.get operation has been improved by avoiding deserialize
the known primary key when deserializing an entity.  Instead, the
known primary key is directly set to the primary key field by the
accessor.
<p>
In our benchmark, there are 500,000 records. The primary key in each
record is a composite key containing an integer field and a String
field, and the size of each record is 180 bytes. With such change, the
performance of PrimaryIndex.get operation (reads 500,000 records, uses
pre-load mode to avoid I/O process) gains nearly 10% improvement.

The improvement will be more significant if there is a large and
complex primary key and small data. [#19248]

<h3><a name="Utilities">Utility Changes:</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
A fix has been made for a bug which allowed an Environment to be
closed while a DbBackup was in progress.  This could cause a checksum
exception (but not data loss).
An <code>EnvironmentFailureException</code> is now thrown by
Environment.close() if the last open <code>Environment</code> handle
is closed between calls to <code>DbBackup.startBackup()</code>
and <code>DbBackup.endBackup()</code>. [19207]

The DbGroupAdmin utility and ReplicationGroupAdmin class now provide a
new updateAddress() method which lets the user change the hostname and
port of a member of a JE replication group.  This new functionality is
useful when a node must be moved to a new host. [#18632]
</li><br>

<li>
A new utility, com.sleepycat.je.rep.util.DbResetRepGroup, has been
added to reset the members of a replication group, replacing the group
with a new group consisting of a single new member. This utility is
useful when a copy of an existing replicated environment needs to be
used at a different site, with the same data, but with a different
initial node that can be used to grow the replication group as usual,
such as may be the case when an application is moved from a staging to
a production environment. The utility can also be used to change the
group name associated with the environment.
